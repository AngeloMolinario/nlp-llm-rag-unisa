Introduction to the LLM and NLP course at the university of salerno (UNISA) |UNISA, course, teacher, name, DIEM|
The Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) course is part of the Master's Degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Salerno, also known by its acronym UNISA. It is taught by Nicola Capuano and Antonio Greco from the DIEM department. The course provides theoretical, methodological, technological, and practical knowledge on automatic language and text understanding. It situates Large Language Models (LLMs) within the broader Natural Language Processing (NLP) framework, highlighting their innovative paradigms and modern applications. The course focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs), providing students with a comprehensive understanding of how machines process, understand, and generate human language. It covers foundational NLP concepts such as tokenization, word embeddings, and text classification, as well as advanced topics like neural networks (e.g., RNNs, LSTMs) and Transformer-based models. Students will explore prompt engineering, which involves crafting effective inputs to guide LLMs, and fine-tuning techniques to adapt pre-trained models for specific tasks. The course also delves into practical applications, such as text generation, translation, and building chatbots. The learning approach is hands-on, with students expected to design and implement NLP systems, based on LLMs, using modern tools and frameworks. The course aims to equip students with both theoretical knowledge and practical skills to work with cutting-edge NLP technologies.

Exam |project work, exam, oral, grade, course|
The exam includes a project work where students apply their knowledge to a real-world problem, followed by an oral exam to discuss their work. The project work is a collaborative effort, requiring each group to develop a chatbot designed to answer questions related to the NLP and LLM 2024/2025 course. The chatbot should provide relevant responses to queries about course content, including lecturers, schedules, and suggested books, while strictly avoiding out-of-context topics. To achieve this, students are encouraged to utilize any tools studied during the course, provided they fully understand their structure, size and behavior. Alongside the chatbot, a detailed report must be submitted, explaining the chosen approach and implementation. The chatbot will be evaluated based on relevance (how well it answers queries), fluency (clarity and grammatical correctness), coherence (logical consistency), robustness (resistance to misleading prompts), and precision (ability to reject out-of-context questions).
The oral examination will assess the theoretical knowledge acquired throughout the course, the ability to justify design choices made in the project work, and the capacity to answer questions on specific topics covered in the lectures. The final grade will be determined as the average of the scores obtained in both assessments.
